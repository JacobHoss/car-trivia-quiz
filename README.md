# Trivia Quiz for Car Enthusiasts!

This program is a timed trivia-quiz based around mostly classic car knowledge. I used vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap to make it. It's timed at 100 seconds. If you miss a question, you lose 10 seconds off the counter. If you answer a question correctly, you accrue 10 points. Your total score is based on the seconds left on the counter and the points you accrued. 

Old-timey music is used to enhance the user experience!
